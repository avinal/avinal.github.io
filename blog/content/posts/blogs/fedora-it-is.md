Fedora is one of the most popular Linux distribution for daily uses as well as
development purpose. I have been a Linux user since 2019 and switched through
multiple distros since then. For a long time I was stuck with Ubuntu and now
finally Fedora. Fedora is an amazing distribution. You get to enjoy the latest
of almost everything. But this all starts with installing Fedora on your system.
Although Fedora is one of the most easy-to-install distribution out there, a lot
of people struggle to install it the right way. There is a lot of tutorials and
blogs as well, but I couldn't find one that answers all my questions and still is
easy to understand and follow along. So I decided to write one.

## What is the best for me?

## Complete automatic installation

## Semi-automatic custom partitioning

## Advanced custom partitioning

### Partition Scheme

| Mount Points | Filesystem | Size (minimum) | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/boot/efi` | EFI | | |
| `/boot` | ext4 | | |
| `/` | ext4 | | |
| `/home` | btrfs | | |
