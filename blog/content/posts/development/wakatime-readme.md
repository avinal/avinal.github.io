If you use WakaTime to track your coding activity. You can add that to
your README as a bar graph or embed it in your blog/portfolio. Just add this
action to any of your repositories and there you have it.

## Implementation Details

This GitHub Action is divided into three parts. I didn't want to use
Docker but it seems it doesn't work well without it. Let dive a little
into technical details. Three parts are as below.

1. [main.py](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/main.py)
    python script. This script contains many procedures.

    - [Getting JSON data file via WakaTime
    API](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/main.py#L52)

    ```python
    def get_stats() -> list:
        ...
        return data_list
    ```

    This function parses the JSON file received and scraps out the useful
    data as a list of lists. Data scraped are language list, time spent on
    each language, percentage of the time, start date, and end date. For
    this action, I have limited the number of languages to 5 however it
    should be very easy to increase that number.

    - [Setting the
    Timeline](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/main.py#L13)

    ```python
    def this_week(dates: list) -> str:
        ...
        return f"Coding Activity During: {week_start.strftime('%d %B, %Y')} to {week_end.strftime('%d %B, %Y')}"
    ```

    The start date and end date scraped in the last function are used here
    to set the timeline. Because date in JSON is provided in UTC as below
    :

    ```json
    date:   "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    ```

    I striped it to simple dates only. We can set them manually by taking
    the current time from the system. But that method is flawed. But this
    method ensures that JSON was received latest and the request was
    successful. Any anomaly will point to a failure in request.

    - [Creating a bar
    graph](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/main.py#L21)

    ```python
    def make_graph(data: list):
        ...
        savefig(...)
    ```

    Lastly, it is time to generate the graph and save them as an image.
    This function uses the data scraped in the first step. Creating a bar
    graph using matplotlib is easy.
    Decorating was a bit difficult. I wanted this graph to merge with
    GitHub's look so I chose to color the bar as GitHub colors the
    languages. That data is stored as colors.json. Many of the languages have
    slightly different spelling in GitHub as compared to WakaTime. So some
    languages are shown in default color. That can be improved if we
    notice that language and change its color manually. Lastly, the graph
    is saved both as SVG and PNG. SVGs are better to put on a responsive
    page.

2. [entrypoint.py](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/entrypoint.sh)
    shell script. This shell script clones the repository copies the
    image and pushes changes to the master. There were several problems.
    First of all authentication. This was solved by using a remote
    repository address using GitHub Token. And it seems that GitHub
    doesn't allow to commit without a username and email. So I used
    **github-actions** bot email.

    ```bash
    remote_repo-"https://${GITHUB_ACTOR}:${INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git"
    git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
    ```

    `41898282` is the id assigned to the github-actions bot. Don't ask
    where I found them ðŸ™‚.

    Another problem was to separate repository name from combined
    *username/repository-name* provided by `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}`. GitHub doesn't
    provides a direct way to get just the repo name. We used *Internal
    Field Separator*. It returns an array and works similar to `split()`
    command in Python and Java.

    ```bash
    # '/' is the seperator
    IFS-'/' read -ra reponame <<< "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"
    # returned {username, repository}
    repository-"${reponame[1]}"
    ```

    After that, all other commands are pretty straight. Commit the added
    files and push them.

3. [Dockerfile](https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    **IMPORTANT** It took a lot of time to reach this state ðŸ¥±. This is
    where all the magic happens. I am running <span
    class="title-ref">ubuntu:latest</span> inside the container. I first
    update the distribution. Then install the required python packages.
    Lastly, I invoke the python script and shell script.

    There was an almost impossible problem, I searched hundreds of posts
    that *how can I access the generated files inside Docker container*, but
    no luck. But at last, I found a workaround(obviously otherwise you
    wouldn't be reading this by now ðŸ¤£) each command is run in a separate
    virtual sub-container. As the command ends its output is also lost but
    not when you club multiple commands together. At least not until every
    command is finished. The generated files are available to the next
    clubbed process. I did that by combining the python script run and shell
    script run.

    ```dockerfile
    CMD python3 /main.py && /entrypoint.sh
    ```

    This part is the smallest yet took the most time and tries while
    developing this action.

## How to use this GitHub Actions?

1. First get your WakaTime API Key. You can get it from your
    [WakaTime](<https://wakatime.com>) account settings.

2. Save WakaTime API Key to Repository Secret. Find that by clicking
    the Settings tab. Keep the name of the secret as
    **WAKATIME_API_KEY**.

3. Add the following line in your README.md of your repo.

    ```html
    <img src="https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>/blob/<branch-name>/images/stat.svg" alt="Alternative Text"/>
    Example: <img src="https://github.com/avinal/avinal/blob/main/images/stat.svg" alt="Avinal WakaTime Activity"/>
    ```

    > You can use this method to embed in web pages too. **Do not use the
    > markdown method of inserting images. It does not work sometimes.**

4. Click the **Action** tab and **choose to set up a workflow
    yourself**.

5. Copy the following code into the opened file, you can search for
    **WakaTime Stat** in the marketplace tab for assistance.

    ```yaml
    name: WakaTime status update

    on:
      schedule:
        # Runs at 12 am  '0 0 * * *'  UTC
        - cron: "1 0 * * *"

    jobs:
      update-readme:
        name: Update the WakaTime Stat
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          # Use avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime@<latest-release-tag> for latest stable release
          # Do not change the line below except the word master with tag number maybe
          # If you have forked this project you can use <username>/Profile-Readme-WakaTime@master instead
          - uses: avinal/Profile-Readme-WakaTime@master
            with:
              # WakaTime API key stored in secrets, do not directly paste it here
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
              # Automatic github token
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
              # Branch - newer GitHub repositories have "main" as default branch, change to main in that case, default is master
              BRANCH: "master"
              # Manual Commit messages - write your own messages here
              COMMIT_MSG: "Automated Coding Activity Update :alien:"
    ```

6. Please wait till 12 AM UTC to run this workflow automatically. Or
    you can force run it by going to the Actions tab. Or you can add the
    following lines under `on:` to run with
    every push. Search for 12 AM UTC to find the equivalent time in your
    time zone.

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
      schedule:
        - cron: '1 0 * * *'
    ```
