I always wanted to have my self-hosted server when I was in college. Never had enough money to do much
until recently. So after I got my first job, I have invested moderately (heavily actually ;)) in gadgets and stuff. And one
of my most prized possession is my Raspberry Pi 4. I have been using it for a while now, and I have
installed many useful things on it. So I thought I would share it with everyone. This is a list of
everything I have on my Pi.

## Hardware and Specifications

- [Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB Model](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
- [Samsung 64GB EVO Plus microSDXC U1 Class 10](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/evo-plus---adapter-microsdxc-64gb-mb-mc64ka-am/)
- [Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/)
- [Rpi shop Raspberry pi 4 case Model B Acrylic case with Fan + heatsink Included](https://amzn.eu/d/8vvwkfg)

I already had a good quality ethernet cable, so I didn't have to buy one.
