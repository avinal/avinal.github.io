I am a Software Engineer II at Red Hat, specializing in hybrid cloud engineering.
I have been involved with Google's Summer of Code and Google Season of Docs
programs as a mentor and contributor to Open Source for many years. For fun,
I like to play around with cutting-edge areas of computer science; at the
moment, I'm learning about Elm. GNU/Linux and free/open-source software are
two of my favorite things
